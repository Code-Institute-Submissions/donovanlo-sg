# UX

## Strategy

The purpose of creating this website is to aid me in the process of getting a job. As a mid-life career changer, I need a resume website highlighting my knowledge and experience to help me stand out from other candidates. It will even be better if any recruiter stumbles upon my website find me suitable for filling a position in their company

### Targeted Audience

The primary purpose of this resume website is the get myself hired, therefore, the website should be 'talking' to the person who can make or influence the decision to hire me.  They are hiring managers and recruitment agencies. The hiring managers may be a HR personnel or potential direct supervisor or head of the department. 

### External Users' Goals

#### Hiring Managers

Half of the external users are identified as HR personnel, potential direct supervisors or heads of departments. ("hiring managers")

Their goals is to hire a right candidate for a position. As such, they are trying to play detective to find out as much detail as possible about me which can help them to decide whether I am the right candidate. After all, they may have to work with me for a few years if they hire me. Before that, they will have to decide whether I am worth taking time, which may last from hours to days, to interview me.

#### Recruitment Agents

The other half of the external users are recruitment agencies. The recruitment agencies need as much information as possible to decide whether I am a match for the positions they are helping to fill. The site should provide supporting factors for selecting me as one of their candidates. 

If either party deem that I am the right candidate for the interview, they will be looking for the contact information.

### Site Owner's Goals

My goals as the site owner is to use it to get myself hired.

Its provide an online presence and a downloadable resume for the hiring managers and recruitment agents.

More importantly, it should serve as a vehicle of communicating things I will like to convey which I may not even have a chance to.

As a mid-career changer, switching career to software development is a tough decision. Apart from the usual negative stereotyping and discrimination against middle and old age people, there is the competition of the agile youngsters freshly graduated from the colleague equipped with the latest programming knowledge.

This site provides the opportunities to showcase my relevant skills ranging from business analysis to coding, knowledge management to design, leadership to communication. It should also allow the hiring managers to get a glimpse of my character and personalities to determine whether I am a culture fit.

The four pages have short and easy recognisable title, namely, 'Home', 'Resume', 'Portfolio' and 'Contact'.

1. The 'Resume' page is layout should be suitable for career changer. It should be effective in showing transferrable skills and experience. It will also contain a link for the visitor to download a pdf copy of the resume. The format of the pdf copy should be similar in layout with the 'resume' page.
