# Donovan Lo Resume website
## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

## Context
Write custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a personal portfolio site for myself of at least 3 pages to  include:

* Tell about educational history and work experience.
* Tell about skills and any other relevant competencies and interests.
* Provide basic personal information and contact information for recruiters.
* Showcase portfolio of projects so far (nice-to-have)
(in-lieu of links to real projects that I'd build later, I'll be including links to other's project at this stage)

External userâ€™s goal: The site's users are recruiters considering to hire the applicant.

Site owner's goal: Present self in best light and get hired.
