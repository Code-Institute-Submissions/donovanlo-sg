# Defining the Project (Strategy, Scope)

The purpose of creating this website is to aid me in the process of getting a job. As a mid-life career changer, I need a resume website highlighting my knowledge and experience to help me stand out from other candidates. It will even be better if any hiring managers tumbles upon my website find me suitable for filling a position in their company.

# Strategy

## Identifying External Users

The primary purpose of this resume website is the get myself hired, therefore, the website should be 'talking' to the person who can make or influence the decision to hire me. They may be business owners, HR managers, depart heads and recruitment agencies (hereafter known as "recruiters")

## Identifying External Users' Goals

The recruiters' goal is to hire a right candidate for a position. 

As such, they will have to play detective, to decide whether the applicants are worth their time, which may last from hours to days, to be interviewed.

    EU1. find out as much detail as possible about the applicants 
    EU2. to decide whether the applicant is qualified
    EU3. to find out whether the applicant has the required skills
    EU4. to see the portfolio of the applicant (if any)
    EU5. to find out how to contact the applicant
    EU6. to print out document to support their decisions when presenting to the decision makers.

They will only have a short span of time due to the overwhelming numbers of applicants starting from the time the recruitment advertisement the job vacancy. 

If an applicant is deemed suitable for a job position, they will be looking for the applicant's contact information.

## Identifying Site Owners' Goals

My goals as the site owner is to use it to get myself hired.

As a mid-career changer, switching career to software development is a tough decision. Apart from the usual negative stereotyping and discrimination against middle and old age people, there is the competition of the agile youngsters freshly graduated from the colleague equipped with the latest programming knowledge. #1
